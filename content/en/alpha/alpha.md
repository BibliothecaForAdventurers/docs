## Welcome to Alpha, Lords & Ladies!

**Some key facts before you delve into the Alpha Realmverse**

- We recommend using a fresh wallet as it will simplify the process of switching networks and so there is no risk of interacting with your mainnet wallet. 
- You will not have access to your owned Realms as this is on an entirely different network (Rinkeby Testnet), so you will have to mint new Realms with your Rinkeby Eth (covered below).


## Getting Rinkeby Eth

1. Head to the [Rinkeby Eth Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
2. Create a fresh wallet
3. Post your wallet address on:
  - To request funds via Twitter, make a tweet with your Ethereum address pasted into the contents (surrounding text doesn't matter). 
  - To request funds via Facebook, publish a new public post with your Ethereum address embedded into the content (surrounding text doesn't matter).
4. Copy-paste the post/tweet's URL into the above input box and fire away! (3 Ethers will be more than enough)
5. You can now delete your social post

## Setting up Arbitrum Testnet

1. Sign in to your Metamask wallet
2. Add the Arbitrum testnet by clicking on the top right dropdown and selecting ‘Custom RPC’ and Create the custom testnet by providing the Arbitrum Testnet details:
  - Network Name: Arbitrum Testnet
  - RPC URL: https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc
  - ChainID: 421611
  - Symbol: ETH
  - Block Explorer URL: https://testnet.arbiscan.io/#/

## Bridging Rinkeby Eth to Arbitrum

1. Head to the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)
2. Connect your Metamask wallet
3. Select the Rinkeby Test Network which has your Rinkeby Eth
4. Enter the amount to bridge (about 50%)
5. Press ‘deposit’ to Layer 2
6. It will take roughly 10 minutes
