## The Realms Wonders
Wonder upkeep Tax

Wonders are mythical properties that demand respect. They are all unique in various ways.


A visual AI-generated Wonder from Realm Lord @CypherPet in our discord.

Whenever someone settles their Realm in the Lootverse, a percentage of their generated resources will be distributed to the holders of settled Wonder Realms. 
This is effectively a tax on the whole system and the Wonder Lords benefit by holding and settling, but may have their own unique upkeep requirements.

The mysterious Wonders will have an impact in other ways on the ecosystem, to be unravelled as time progresses through the ages.
