## Building Costs

This table shows the economic and military impact of each building type. It also shows the resource requirement to build each type of building. For example, building a shipyard will add 100 to a realm's military offence, 200 to military defence, but will increase food consumption by 2 units. To build the shipyard, you'll need 200 wood, 200 silver, 200 ironwood, 200 hartwood. Also, note that a the number of shipyards is constrained by the number of harbours. So if your realm has 11 harbors, you can only build 11 shipyards.
