## What is the $LORDS token?

The $LORDS Token is a soon to be released ERC20 token that powers the Realmverse. 
It will have a variety of uses, such as trading between resources in the Merchant Marketplace (an ERC-1155 Automated Market Maker or AMM),  earning fees for providing liquidity, and purchasing future in-game items. 

### What is the total supply?

There will be a hard cap of 500m $LORDS tokens as defined in the contract.

### How do I get the token?

Initially the token will be distributed to Realm stakers that take part in the Journey contract. Any Lord or Lady with a Realm can partake in this Journey.

The hard cap of tokens distributed is expected to  be reached after 2 years, with exact rates will be published soon. Each Realm will receive the same amount of $LORDS - and is not impacted by features such as rarity, resources, traits or wonders.

The team will be providing LP incentives on AMM.

### Issuance breakdown

**Core Team (5%)** - Allocated for months spent by the Bibliotheca team to launch the Settling game on StarkNet and to establish the Realms economy. Half (2.5%) of these will be awarded at mainnet launch of the Settling game, and the other half will be allocated 3 (2.5%) months later.

<br>

**Bibliotheca DAO treasury (22.5%)** -Allocated to fund the future development of the game including marketing, developer bounties, artistic creations and other opportunities as decided by the DAO (currently governed by Realm holders). This will be unminted until the DAO votes.

<br>

**Liquidity (5%)** - Allocated for establishing initial liquidity pools (resources and ethers) and for incentives to liquidity providers.

<br>

**The Journey (1% first 10 weeks, 0.5% thereafter)** - Allocated to Realms that embark on the Journey (staking) to layer 2 in the process approved in the prior proposal at <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/bibliotheca.eth/proposal/0xd1cd38aa6fd44bc595aeb577232b31ce3dfde8db1c57df4f95ae5bf287b42ec3">Snapshot proposal </a>
The rate (1% initially) will be allocated at a fixed rate per epoch (e.g 625 $LORDS per realm per week) - which would distribute the full amount proposed if all 8000 Realms are staked.
