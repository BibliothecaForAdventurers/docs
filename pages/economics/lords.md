## What is the Lords token?



The Lords Token is a soon to be released ERC20 token that powers the Realmverse. 
It will have a variety of uses, such as trading between resources in the Merchant Marketplace (an ERC-1155 Automated Market Maker or AMM),  earning fees for providing liquidity, and purchasing future in-game items. 

### How do I get the token?

The Lords Token will be distributed to Settled Realm Lords with a decreasing emission rates rewarding early settlers. 
The hard cap of tokens distributed is expected to  be reached after 2 years, with exact rates will be published soon. Each Realm will receive the same amount of Lords - and is not impacted by features such as rarity, resources, traits or wonders.

### Other Issuance

A portion of Lords tokens will be allocated to the Community Treasury (controlled by Realm Holders DAO) for future development of the the Settling game and Realms assets expansion, as well as marketing efforts. 
The core Bibliotheca team will also be allocated a portion based on contribution towards creating a launchable product. 
It is currently to be decided whether the Realms DAO will be able to alter token distribution - such as increasing the hard cap of tokens - or changing the issuance rate.
