## What is the $LORDS token?

The $LORDS Token is a ERC20 token that powers the Realmverse. 
It will have a variety of uses, such as trading between resources in the Merchant Marketplace (an ERC-1155 Automated Market Maker or AMM), earning fees for providing liquidity, purchasing NFTs, and purchasing future in-game items. 

The NFT Marketplace will be 100% denominated in $LORDS. A 5% commission from all transactions will flow into the DAO multisig address to be reinvested back into the protocol.

### What is the total supply?

There will be a hard cap of 500m $LORDS tokens as defined in the contract.

### How do I get the token?

Initially the token will be distributed to Realm stakers that take part in the Journey contract. Any Lord or Lady with a Realm can partake in this Journey.

The hard cap of tokens distributed is expected to  be reached after 2-5 years, with exact rates will be published soon. Each Realm will receive the same amount of $LORDS - and is not impacted by features such as rarity, resources, traits or wonders. The inflation rate will be tied to the growth of the protocol.

The team will be providing LP incentives on AMM.

### Issuance breakdown

**Core Team (5%)** - Allocated for months spent by the Bibliotheca team to launch the Settling game on StarkNet and to establish the Realms economy. Half (2.5%) of these will be awarded at mainnet launch of the Settling game, and the other half will be allocated 3 (2.5%) months later.

<br>

**Bibliotheca DAO treasury (22.5%)** -Allocated to fund the future development of the game including marketing, developer bounties, artistic creations and other opportunities as decided by the DAO (currently governed by Realm holders). This will be unminted until the DAO votes.

<br>

**Liquidity (5%)** - Allocated for establishing initial liquidity pools (resources and ethers) and for incentives to liquidity providers.

<br>

**The Journey (1% first 10 weeks, 0.5% thereafter)** - Allocated to Realms that embark on the Journey (staking) to layer 2 in the process approved in the prior proposal at <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/bibliotheca.eth/proposal/0xd1cd38aa6fd44bc595aeb577232b31ce3dfde8db1c57df4f95ae5bf287b42ec3">Snapshot proposal </a>
The rate (1% initially) will be allocated at a fixed rate per epoch (e.g 625 $LORDS per realm per week) - which would distribute the full amount proposed if all 8000 Realms are staked. If the target of bridging to StarkNet takes longer than the proposed 10 weeks, the Journey will continue but with a 0.5% $LORDS distribution per epoch. 

<br>

**Game Emissions (57.5%)** - The 57.5% $LORDS is to be allocated to the Realms that are playing the Settling Game once launched. You will be required to Settle (stake) your StarkNet Realm in the game contract to be entitled to this. These emissions will follow a supply curve tied to the growth of the protocol. This was originally set at 2 years, however depending on the growth of the protocol this could take significantly longer to distribute.
