## Military Costs

The table below shows the 4 types of military units that will be available in the initial launch. Each unit type has a unique impact on the military strength of the realm. For example, building a Trebuchet adds 300 to the realm's defence and costs 200 wood, 100 copper, 100 ironwood, and 50 cold iron. The number of trebuchet's a realm can have is limited to 5 times the number of castles.  Also, building a military unit takes time! Once you initiate a trebuchet build, it will take 8 hours to complete.
