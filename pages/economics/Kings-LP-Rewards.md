## How to earn rewards 

The pools' first epoch has a total reward of 10k LORDS per day, running from the 28th December 2021 until the 28th January 2022. 
Rewards are distributed according to the share of the in-range liquidity pool (out of range positions will not accrue Lords).

To earn the Kings' Rewards, you will first need to:
1. Provide liquidity to the Uniswap V3 pool created at https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/ETH/0x686f2404e77Ab0d9070a46cdfb0B7feCDD2318b0/3000 (you will receive a Uniswap V3 position NFT in return). This will require an equal value of ETH and LORDS.

2. Your position will show at https://bibliothecaforloot.com/settling. Click Deposit & Stake to enter the pool and you will start earning LORDS per block (in addition to any fees earned from the Uniswap protocol)

3. You will be able to claim any elegible LORDS after unstaking, or at the end of the incentive period.

Providing liquidity comes with its own set of risks, and you should make sure you are informed before making any financial decisions or choices of liquidity ranges.
