## What is a MMOCCG?

An MMOCCG is a Massivley Multiplayer On-Chain Composable Game. Let's upack this one by one.

### Massively multiplayer
Games are no fun with small amounts of people. The reason for World of Warcrafts success is it's massive amount of players. Each player added brings value and fun for the other players around them. This is an extremly powerful network effect.

### On-chain
Traditional online games (WOW, CS etc) are all played on centralised servers. This means that all the information is siloed within that companies servers. This information is your data; what you have done, what you own within the game and any other bits of data that has been accumulated.

The company has total control over this information. If they decide they want to shut the game off tomorrow, you will loose everything you own. **We are developing the opposite of this.**

> The entire gameplay of Settling will be recorded on the blockchain and live permanently within it.

This is a new paradigm of ownership over your data. You will be in total control of your game assets. If you wish to leave the game, you will be able to sell or transfer the work you have done to another player and leave with your liquidity.


### Composable
Imagine a world where websites could not link to each other? The internet would be a very boring place. Luckily, this is not true, and you can link (compose) websites together to create more value than what the individual website can bring. This is composability. 

Within current games there is minimal, if any composability, because they are all running of different companies servers.

Blockchains enable data and computation composability across games that was previously unheard of. This is because they all share the same database and execution layer (the blockchain).

### Game
We don't need to explain this one :)
