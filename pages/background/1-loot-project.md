## What is Loot?
The NFT game changed forever when Loot dropped on the 27th of August. Loot is the first NFT project of its kind and was created by VINE co-creator Dom Hofmann.

So what is Loot? Each loot bag contains 8 items: a piece for an adventurer’s chest, foot, hand, head, neck, ring, waist, and weapon. By itself it’s nothing, but add derivatives and it equals breakthrough economic incentive.

“Loot is randomized adventurer gear generated and stored on-chain. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. Feel free to use Loot in any way you want.” — DOM
