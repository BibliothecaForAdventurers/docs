# What is the Game

Settling is an open source MMOCG (Massively Multiplayer On-Chain Game) of economics and Chivalry built on-top of ZK STARKS. The goal of the game is to build up your Realm, form alliances and harvest resources. If you do not maintain and defend your realm, you will be raided and your resources lost. If you disregard your Realm itâ€™s value will decay.

### What are Realms?

Realms are a Loot Project derivative 8,000 procedurally generated map with unique:
- Names & language
- Resource allocations (of different rarities such as Wood and Diamonds)
- Wonders (50 in the 8000 realms)
- Geographical traits such as harbors and cities
- The code to originally generate Realms was forked from https://github.com/mewo2/terrain under an MIT license.
