## Our vision of GameFi

DeFi hit the world like a technological Cambrian explosion. No longer was liquidity tied to individuals' wallets, now it was programmable and now it's the infrastructure that drives the crypto metaverse. The composability across DeFi protocols has unlocked capital flow that wasn’t possible previously. As DeFi unlocked capital for cryptonatives, we believe GameFi will unlock liquidity at the consumer non-cryptonative level. 

The final boss to defeat for Liquid GameFi to thrive is gas prices. It’s been clear for a long time that Ethereum L1 is not suitable for microtransactions and computation. L2s, more specifically ZK rollups is where we believe the true metaverse will emerge. 


## What is a Rollup?
Vitalik gives a good overview of the rollup solutions at https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html

For a brief overview:
### Optimistic Rollup
*Pros*
- First to launch
- More developer tooling
- Complete EVM
- Established TVL

*Cons*
- 7 Day lockup period to withdrawal
- Less transaction per second
- High fees - and increasing relative to ETH fees

### ZK Rollup
Deep dive into Zks - https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K

*Pros*
- Lower fees and more scalability (fees decrease with more transactions on the network)
- Instant withdrawals to L1
- Each transactions is validated by cryptographic proof - not “optimistic” reliance on fraud proofs - therefore finality means transactions cant be reordered like in Optimisic’s 7 day dispute period


*Cons*
- Less tooling - not as established e.g user account interaction not yet implemented by MetaMask, no subgraphs
- Not EVM
