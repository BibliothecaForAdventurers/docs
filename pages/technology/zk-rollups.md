DeFi hit the world like a technological cambrian explosion. No longer was liquidity tied to individuals wallets, now it was programmable and now it's the infrastructure that drives the crypto metaverse. The composability across DeFi protocols has unlocked capital flow that wasn’t possible previously. As DeFi unlocked capital for cryptonatives, we believe GameFi will unlock liquidity at the consumer non-cryptonative level. 

The final boss to defeat for Liquid GameFi to thrive is gas prices. It’s been clear for a long time that Ethereum L1 is not suitable for microtransactions and computation. L2s, more specifically ZK rollups is where we believe the true metaverse will emerge. 

Below we will outline our vision for a liquid composable GameFi metaverse and our first game that will leverage the composability, cost and speed of Zk roll-ups. This game's backend will entirely be built on-chain, only the client will run on a central server, however anyone could build a more compelling UI if they choose.
