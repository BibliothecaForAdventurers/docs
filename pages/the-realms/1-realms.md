## What is Realms?

Realms was one of the very first derivatives of Loot to emerge and fundamentally contain many of the elements required for the foundations of a functional metaverse.

Each of the 8,000 Realms is a procedurally generated map with unique:
- Names
- Resource allocations (of different rarities such as Wood and Diamonds)
- Wonders (50 in the 8000 realms)
- Geographical traits such as harbors and cities
- Orders (such as The Order of Power)

These foundations (along with including fantastic pieces of generative art) provide some strong mechanisms for Bibliotheca to provide the Realm Lords & Ladies with on-chain utility, such as resource generation and housing fungible primitives allowing for economic games.
