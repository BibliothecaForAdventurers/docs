## What is Realms?

Realms was one of the very first derivatives of Loot to emerge and fundamentally contain many of the elements required for the foundations of a functional metaverse.

Each of the 8,000 Realms is a procedurally generated map with the following unique properties stored on-chain:
- Names
- Resource allocations (of different rarities such as Wood and Diamonds)
- Wonders (50 in the 8000 realms)
- Geographical traits such as harbors and cities
- Orders (such as The Order of Power)

These foundations (along with including fantastic pieces of generative art) provide some strong mechanisms for Bibliotheca to provide the Realm Lords & Ladies with on-chain utility, such as resource generation and housing fungible primitives allowing for economic games.

## What can I do with a Realm?

Since Bibliothecaâ€™s inception, its vision has been a unified and integrated metaverse, both within Loot (for Adventurers) derivatives and beyond. Bibliotheca aims to provide a layer of utility (P2E gaming) and experience tools for both the developers, users, and owners of these projects.

Currently our team of full-stack and solidity developers are tirelessly buildingly a settling game on StarkNet that will allow:

- Settling (aka staking) Realms
- Receiving $LORDS
- Generating resources (in the form of ERC-1155 tokens)
- Spending resources to upgrade production and buildings (affecting attack, defense, magic and happiness)
- Marketplace to trade resources (using $LORDS as liquidity)
- PvP contracts (raiding for resources 1v1, wars involving multiple Realms etc)
- Much more!
