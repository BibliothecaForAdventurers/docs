## What is a Raid

After settling your Realm, you will begin to generate the resources native to your land that will be stored in your vault. These resources will be at risk of being raided and stolen between the time they become available to claim to your wallet and before you action it.

The raider will enter this PvP contract with your Realm, and the conqueror will be determined by a probability skewed by defence/offense buildings and will receive the bounty of resources from the conquered.
