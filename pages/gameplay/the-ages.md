## Ages

There will be a steeped supply curve of $LORDS which will reward early settlers with a higher percentage of the distribution.

This will be represented by Ages. Each Age will last one week and will have a total supply of $LORDS that will decrease over time.

Lords distribution = total supply / sRealms (settled Realms) in the age

For a Realm to be entitled to the $LORDS distribution, it must be settled the full week of that Age. Settling a Realm two days into an Age will only entitle the Lord/Lady to the $LORDS supply of the following Age (if they remain settled that week).

The Age of Genesis will have the largest supply of $LORDS distributed, and therefore for Realm Lords/Ladies who settle early will receive the highest distribution of the game.

In the future, certain Ages will contain some element that will benefit particular Lords/Ladiesâ€™ settled Realms, such as the Titan Age, which could provide a higher $LORDS distribution to Realms of the Titan Order.
