## What is an Army?

Armies are your defence and offence in the Realmverse. Protecting a realm from hostile neighbors and would-be raiders will be of primary importance to worthy realm holders. As your realm grows rich in resources, it may become the target of opportunity-seeking Realm Lords. Or, perhaps, you will decide to join forces with Lords of your order and initiate a raid on the unsuspecting. Whatever your military strategy may be, you will need a strong army.  

### Building an Army

There are four basic military units: knights, foot soldiers, trebuchets, and ballistas. Knights and foot soldiers are offensive units.  Trebuchets, and ballistas are defensive units. Each military unit has a unique resource requirement for building/training and contributes uniquely to the overall offensive / defensive capability of the realm. Each unit also has a unique constraint. For example, you must have at least 1 barracks for every 2 foot soldiers and you'll need to build a castle before you can build a trebuchet or ballista. Check out the [Military Unit Statistics](../economics/military_costs.md) page for details.  Each of these units have a special role in the Realm Lord's military strategy and are a primary economic driver in the Realmverse.

### How to Build Military Units
To build a military unit, just hover over the build button for the unit you want to build. A window will pop up showing the resources required to build and what you currently have available. If you have the resources, just click the 'Build Unit' button!
